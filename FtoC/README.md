##FtoC Work Log

- First, I created a variable f (Fahrenheit) and used a prompt to get the input

`
let f = prompt("What is the temperature in Fahrenheit?");
`

- Next, I wrote the formula to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.

`
let c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9;
`

- Finally, I printed the result to the console and used .toFixed(1) to round the decimal places.

`
console.log(c.toFixed(1));
`
