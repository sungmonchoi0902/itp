#Python Reading

##Things I Already Knew

1. From earlier classes, I aleady understood that a program is not just a random collection of code. It is a sequence of instructions designed to perform a specific calculation or solve a particular problem. That is a program follows a logical flow to carry out a task.(Chapter1)

2. I already knew that a function must be defined before it can be executed. I learned this earlier in the course, so the idea that Python needs to know what a function is before running it was already familiar to me.(Chaper3)

3. I also understood the basic concept of if and else statements. Since I had seen conditional structures before, recognizing how Python makes decisions based on conditions was something I felt comfortable with.(Chapter5)

4. I had previously learned about lists when practicing with the terminal, so I already knew that a list is a structure that stores multiple values in order. I was also familiar with the idea that each value in a list is called an element, and that a list functions somewhat like a collection of items.(Chapter10)

##Things I Did Not Know

1. I did not know that the overall flow is typically organized as input, output, main execution, conditional execution, and repetition. Understanding this broader structure helped me see how a program is designed from start to finish.(Chapter1)

2. I didn’t know until now that when a function is called, the program execution don’t just continue downward. Instead, it temporarily 'jumps' into the function and then returns to the original point after finishing. Previously, I only thought of it as 'the function runs' but now I understand that this jump in control flow is a very important concept in programming.(Chaper3)

3. I knew about the logical operators and and or, but I didn't learned about not before. Through this chapter, I understood that not reverses a condition, and that it can be very important when writing conditional statements or handling boolean logic.Chapter5)

4. I didn’t know that lists are mutable which means their elements could be changed, replaced, or removed. I only knew that strings are immutable, so learning that lists behave differently, especially that modifying a list inside a function can change the original list, was something new for me.(Chapter10)
